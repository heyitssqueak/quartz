measurement The final figure is the &amp;ldquo;estimated&amp;rdquo; figure &amp;ndash; keep all sure digits and one estimated digit Don&amp;rsquo;t count leading zeroes when counting sig figs, but include tailing zeroes Keep all digits until calculations are finished and round after Addition/subtraction: the last significant figure after the decimal point can&amp;rsquo;t be more accurate than any of the operands, meaning the # of sig figs (after decimal) is the same as the lowest out of the operands Multiplication/division: lowest # of sigfigs among all operands, note that it&amp;rsquo;s NUMBER of sigfigs which is different than after the decimal point reading ch1: physics and measurement SI system of measurement: Length (meters) as the distance between two points Mass (kilograms) as an object&amp;rsquo;s amount of material&amp;hellip; Time (seconds) Density ($\rho$): $\rho\equiv\frac{m}{V}$; mass per unit volume Sometimes we want to express really small numbers, which we can do so using scientific notation and order of magnitude, where the ~ symbol denotes &amp;ldquo;is on the order of&amp;rdquo;, ex: 720m ~ (is about) 10^3m ch2: motion in one dimension Position ($x$): location of the particle with respect to an origin point Displacement ($\Delta x)$: $\Delta x\equiv x_f-x_i$; change in position over a time interval Average velocity (m/s): $v_{x,avg}\equiv\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$; displacement per time interval Instantaneous velocity (m/s): $v_x\equiv\frac{dx}{dt}$; velocity at a moment in time Distance: length of a path travelled by a particle — different than displacement Displacement can be zero even if distance is not zero, ex: moving down a hallway and then returning to the starting position has a displacement of 0, but a distance of the length of the hallway travelled * 2 Average speed (m/s): $v_{avg}\equiv\frac{d}{\Delta t}$; distance per time interval Instantaneous speed (m/s): magnitude of instantaneous velocity Vector: direction and magnitude; Scalar: numerical value and no direction A particle can have a constant velocity, which implies that it has a constant speed; however, constant speed does not imply constant velocity (magnitude can stay the same, but direction doesn’t always) Problem solving approach: conceptualize, categorize/simplify, analyze, finalize Average acceleration ($a_{x,avg}=\frac{\Delta v_x}{\Delta t}$): measured in $\frac{m}{s^2}$ and describes the change in velocity over time Instantaneous acceleration ($a_x=\frac{dv_x}{dt}$): ch4: motion in two dimensions Position vector ($\vec{r}$): $\vec{r}=x\vec{i}+y\vec{j}$; location of the particle with respect to the origin of a coordinate system Displacement vector ($\Delta \vec{r}$): $\Delta \vec{r}\equiv\vec{r}_f-\vec{r}_i$; a vector that describes the change in position vectors Average velocity: $\vec{v}_{avg}\equiv\frac{\Delta\vec{r}}{\Delta t}$; displacement vector per time interval, or how much the displacement changes for every $t$ &amp;ndash; results in a vector along $\Delta\vec{r}$ Instantaneous velocity: $\vec{v}\equiv\frac{d\vec{r}}{dt}$; velocity vector at a moment in time, tangent to the particle&amp;rsquo;s path Speed ($|\vec{v}|$) of the particle is the magnitude of the instantaneous velocity Average acceleration ($\vec{a}_{avg}\equiv\frac{\Delta\vec{v}}{\Delta t}$) and instantaneous acceleration ($\vec{a}\equiv\frac{d\vec{v}}{dt}$) describe the change in velocity per $t$ and as $t$ approaches 0 respectively Under constant accerlation, we can assume the following equations: (Search &amp;ldquo;four kinematics equations&amp;rdquo;) $\vec{v}_f=\vec{v}_i+\vec{a}t$ $\vec{r}_f=\vec{r}_i+\vec{v}_it+\frac{1}{2}\vec{a}t^2$ $\vec{r}_f=\vec{r}_i+\frac{1}{2}(\vec{v}_i+\vec{v}_f)t$ $\vec{v}_f^2=\vec{v}_i^2-2\vec{a}\Delta\vec{r}$ Movement in the $x$ direction does not affect movement in the $y$ direction &amp;ndash; motion in 2d can be modelled as two independent motions Projectile motion is parabolic motion through the air where we assume free-fall acceleration is constant and air resistance is negligible One specific case of projectile motion is when it returns to the same horizontal level as when it starts $h$ is the maximum height ($h=\frac{v_i^2\sin^2\theta_i}{2g}$), while $R$ is the horizontal range of the particle ($R=\frac{v_i^2\sin2\theta_i}{g}$) $R$ is at its maximum when $\theta$ is 45 degrees</description></item></channel></rss>
