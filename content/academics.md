<!-- ## CS 475: Introduction to Combinatorics*
**Professor:** Aleksandra Sobieska, Fall '22

Taught me about all of those vague competitive-coding/math problems I never knew how to solve. How many ways can you traverse an $n$ by $n$ grid without crossing the diagonal? How many unique necklaces can I make with 4 different colored beads? What's $5\choose 2$? This class will teach you. Incredibly biased personal take, but I loved this class and the professor was amazing; if you get a chance to take any of her classes, take it. Computational math, not a lot of emphasis on proofs; ten homeworks and three exams total.

## CS 252: Introduction to Computer Engineering
**Professor:** Jim Skrentny, Fall '22

## ECE 537: Communication Networks*
**Professor:** Bhuvana Krishnaswamy, Fall '22

Goes through each layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack. If you zone out for a second, you'll wake up 10 lectures behind. Super interesting but very fast paced. I really enjoyed the content and the professor was extremely knowledgeble about the topics.

<!-- #### CS 220: Data Programming I
Basic introduction course to coding in Python. Decent takeaway on the pandas library (Series and DataFrames) and working with Jupyter notebooks. Dry, but it got the point across.

#### CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs
Also an introductory course in Python (and a bit of Scheme), but with a focus on recursion and creative problem-solving as opposed to pure fundamentals. A step up from CS 220. Assignments were both interesting and challenging. -->

<!--
#### CS 252: Introduction to Computer Engineering
Great for if you want to lose 10% of your exam score on a tiny mistake.

#### ECE 537: Communication Networks
Goes through each layer of the TCP/IP protocol stack in detail. If you zone out for a second, you'll wake up 10 lectures behind. Super interesting but very fast paced. I came out of the class with more questions than I had going in. This class was the definition of "I understand all of those words individually, but not when you put them together".

#### PHYSICS 201: General Physics
Kinematics. Forces. Energy and momentum. Multiple choice tests.

#### MSE 299: Independent Study (ML4ER) -->
