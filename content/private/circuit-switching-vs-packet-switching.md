title: "Circuit Switching vs. Packet Switching"
---

# TL;DR
- **Circuit switching:** dedicated resources through physical connection.
    - üëç: Fast! Smooth connection! Reliable!
    - üëé: Unscalable! Wasted resources!
- **Packet switching:**

# background
Circuit switching is based on old telephone lines which were physically connected to one another. Telephone operators would manually make connections between callers in order for a connection to be established. 






















[link to relevant classes here]

# what is circuit switching?
A dedicated communication path is established for communication between a sender and a receiver. This allows for resources to be allocated specifically to this connection.

the bandwidth (mbps) is fixed and the data transmission is also fixed
connection-oriented?

# what is packet switching?

unused capacity in a circuit switched network is actually capacity that can be allocated to all other message transfers in a pkt switched networks

fiber optic cables under the water at the bottom of the ocean and they can transfer huge amoungs of data

nobody connects the phone calls manually anymore so how do the phone call know where to go??

Circuit switching is only used for landline phones now?










Circuit switching is/was mostly used in landlines.
2G and 3G used both circuit and packet switching. 4G transferred fully to packet switching. **How does handheld phones work with circuit switching?**

For circuit switched networks, there are cables all over the place.
Within a certain region there is a "subscriber loop" and further out there are "trunks" (or large bundles of wires that run from location to location) that connect to switching offices.
Your phone call moves through multiple locations before it gets to the receiving device.
The utility boxes (telephone cabinet? telephone box?) have a shit ton of cables inside that are dedicated towards routing lines to homes in the area.

Circuit switch establishes a physical connection while the information is being transferred... I'm confused about how a handheld device will establish connection to a circuit switched network though.
