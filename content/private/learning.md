Half a year ago I set my sights on competing in the DEFCON 30 csec qualifiers. I had it in my mind that an 18 year old with zero csec experience could be the youngest person to earn a DEFCON Black Badge. I did not compete in the qualifiers. I am still a complete beginner in the csec world.

Around that time I grew interested in setting up my own website. Cloudflare gave me the option to add A, CNAME, MX among other kinds of records. I vividly remember not knowing what any of those acronyms meant. Now I know. This semester I took networking class. I know very little in the grand scheme of things. I have barely grazed the surface of all this computing knowledge.
