## introduction to networks
- Internet -- network of networks
- Computer network structure can look like this: end device (phone) -> router -> Internet Service Provider (ISP) -> ?? -> server
	- Router can be wifi router or a cellular provider
		- Redirects connection on where to go next ...
	- ISP connect determines how good router connection is (and also your phone to the router)
- Any ~~link~~ connection between two devices can be wireless
- **TCP/IP protocol stack:** physical > link > network > transport > application
	- (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
	- An *application* level protocol could look like this: client (browser tab) -> ISP -> backbone/hall network (?) -> server
		- Nothing between client and server actually understand the information transferred -- this means applications are End-to-End protocol, only the end devices understand what's going on
	- Physical (layers) need *everyone* to understand the content that passes through (I think it's less private?)
	<!-- - Transport takes one layer to another?? probably e2e protocol -->
	- Network has protocols that define many stops/nodes (such as ISP, servers) but each stop/node only knows its own predecessor and successor, known as **routing layers**
		- Each node only cares about getting to the next node and doesn't affect other information being transferred
		- Network protocol is lower level than application/transport, so any changes on those protocols won't affect network protocol efficiency
	- Link layer protocol manages multiple devices talking to one service/router
		- No protocols with only link layer! always linked to physical 
		- Wifi/ethernet is link and physical
- Transport/application only need to be understood by end devices; link and physical protocol need to be understood by *all devices in the network*
- **OSI protocol stack:** physical > link > network > transport > session > presentation > application (industry standard)

## network architecture
- Networks transfer chunks of information called **packets**
	- Data deconstruction (creating packets) is handled by the client, while data reconstruction/packet synthesizing is handled by whoever is receiving the data
- Two main types of network systems:
	- **Circuit switched network:**
		- A connection of a certain mbps is dedicated to the user for the entire duration of the information transfer
		- Pros:
			- Connection does not delay or break because it's allocated already
			- You are guaranteed whatever connection speed the whole time
			- Less inturruption -> reliable
		- Cons:
			- Expansion requires exponentially more resources so it's not scalable
			- Resource is not allocated based on need
	- **Packet switched network:**
		- Information is broken into packets/segments which are transferred individually and only use the connection when a transfer is in progress
		- Pros:
			- Network is easy to expand -- add more nodes (routers) that can accept and redirect incoming information
			- More people can use the same amount of resources since any downtime between a conversation can be put towards transferring someone else's data
		- Cons:
			- Packets can arrive out of order which cause delays
			- Networks can be overloaded or slow depending on usage
- Four main types of *delays*:
	- **Processing delay:** 
		- Time it takes to process the packet (add a header?) and find the next location to send it to
			- Does NOT depend on packet size -- all packets take the same time to get ready (I assume?)
		- Depends solely on the hardware and processing power of the router
	- **Propagation delay:**
		- Time it takes for the packet to *physically* travel through a medium (fiber optic cables, waves, wireless) to its destination
		- Depends on the distance between two nodes and the speed of the transport medium
	- **Transmission delay:**
