# lectures
## intro
- Main components of the computer:
	- Processor - CPU; memory - RAM; motherboard; GPU; cooling; power supply
	- Storage -- SSD, HDD, thumbdrives, hard drives
		- Remembers things after the power is turned off
	- Output devices -- displays, sound
	- Input devices -- keyboard, mice, touch
- CPU components:
	- Bus memory; control unit; memory (cache, register); ALU FPU; clock

## ch2: bits, data types, and operations
-   Devices inside the computer react to the presence/absence* of voltages, rather than the actual voltage values
    -   Presence of voltage is represented as 1, while absence is represented as 0 — these 1s and 0s are called **bits**
    -   *Not the absolute presence/absence, but differentiate between “close to” and “far from” a target voltage, ex: if I wanted 3 volts, then 2.6 volts would signify a 1 (close to 3 volts) and 0.2 volts would signify a 0 (far from 3 volts)
-   With $k$ bits, we can distinguish at most $2^k$ different values, by counting in binary
-   Unsigned (and signed) integers can be represented using the **2’s complement integers**
    -   Each digit in a binary string represents 2 to the power of that digit multiplied by 0 or 1
        $00110 = 0\cdot2^4+0\cdot2^3+1\cdot2^2+1\cdot2^1+0\cdot2^0=6$
-   For signed integers, the leading value (on the left) signifies positive or negative — leading 0 is positive, leading 1 is negative

    -   $k$ bits can represent the range $[-2^{k-1}, 2^{k-1})$ where negative numbers are denoted by a leading 1
        -   Shortcut for $-A(A\ne0)$: flip all bits of $A$ and add 1
    -   The carry for the leading digit is always ignored (because adding 00001 and 11111 does not make sense to produce 100000 when working with signed digits)
- **Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)** takes two inputs and one output to apply arithmetic
- To convert from binary to decimal, we can multiply the $i$th bit (from the right) of the 2's complement number by $2^i$ and add a negative sign if the leading digit is 1
- Algorithm for converting from decimal to binary:
	- *If $N$ is odd, the rightmost bit is 1. If $N$ is even, the rightmost bit is 0.
	- Subtract 1 or 0 depending on if $N$ is even or odd, and divide by 2, adding 1 or 0 depending on even/odd
	- Example:
		```text
		[ converting 105 to binary ]
		N = 105       : 1 (rightmost bit is 1 because N is odd)
		  = 105-1     :   (subtract 1 because N is odd)
		  = 104/2     :   (divide by 2)
		N = 52        : 01 (next bit is 0 because N is even)
		  = 52-0      :    (N is even)
		  = 52/2      :    (divide by 2)
		N = 26        : 001 (next bit is 0)
		  = (26-0)/2  : 
		N = 13        : 1001 (next bit is 1)
		  = (13-1)/2  :
		N = 6         : 01001
		  = (6-0)/2   :
		N = 3         : 101001
		  = (3-1)/2   : 
		N = 1         : 1101001
		```
- Addition with bits remains the same as normal arithmetic, but subtraction is "adding the negative number"
	- Two numbers must have the same number of bits to be added
	- Leading 0s (or 1s for negative numbers) can be added to the front of the number to achieve equal numbers of bits -- this process is called **Sign-EXTension, or SEXT**
- **Overflow** happens when the ALU can't represent arithmetic between two integers
	- Example: I want to add $01001$ (11) and $01011$ (9) but I get $10100$ which is -4 (leading 1 means negative)
	- Example: Adding $10100$ (-6) and $11010$ (-12) gets $01110$ which is 14
- **Logical functions** can also be applied on binary numbers, requiring two pieces of input (either 1 or 0)
	- **AND:** produces 1 only if both sources have value 1, otherwise produces 0 (if both are true -> true, else false)
	- **OR:** produces 0 only if both sources have value 0, otherwise produces 1 (if either is true -> true, else false)
	- **NOT:** flip the bit
	- **XOR:** exclusive-or, produces 1 only if *one or the other* input bit is 1, but produces 0 when both inputs are 1
	-
		| A  | B | XOR |
		| --- | --- | --- |
		| 0 | 0 | 0 |
		| 0 | 1 | 1 |
		| 1 | 0 | 1|
		| 1 | 1 | 0|
- **Bit vectors** can keep track of the "status" $n$ units where a bit is 1 if the unit is free and 0 if the unit is busy
	- **Bit masks** can be used to change the status of one single bit
- Floating point data is used to represent really big or small numbers with scientific notation (ex: $6.032\times 10^{23}$ instead of $603200000000000000000000$)
	- ![[Pasted image 20220911103146.png]]
	- 8 bits are allocated to the "exponent" while 23 bits are allocated to the sig figs (the 6032 in the previous example)
		- The exponent value actually represents your exponent value plus 127 (??)
	- Example:
	```text
	floating point data: 00111101100000000000000000000000
		
	0 01111011 00000000000000000000000
	0 - represents positive number
	01111011 - equals 123, subtract 127, we get -4 as the exponent
	00000000000000000000000 - no fraction, so the number represented is 1

	1^(-4) = 1/16
	```
- Other common data codes/notations: ASCII, hexadecimal
