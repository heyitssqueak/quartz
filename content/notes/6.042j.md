## introduction to proofs

- a **proposition** is a statement that is either true or false
- the $::=$ means “equal by definition” and usually just $=$ is used
- you can’t check a claim about an infinite set by checking a finite set of elements
- symbols
    - $\forall$ for all
    - $\mathbb{N}$ nonnegative integers
    - $\in$ is in, is a member of, belongs to
    - $\mathbb{Z}^+$ positive integers

**Proposition.** $313(x^3+y^3)=z^3$ has no solution when $x$, $y$, $z \in\mathbb{Z}^+$.

This latter part can be read as “when $x$, $y$, $z$ are in the set of all positive integers” or simpler, there is no solution when $x$, $y$, $z$ are all positive. This proposition is false (but the counterexample has more than 1000 digits.)

- a **predicate** is a proposition whose truth depends on variables and is denoted by [a letter with a function-like notation], ex: “$n$ is a perfect square” depends on the value of the variable $n$
    - $P(n)::=$ “$n$ is the perfect square”, where we can say $P(4)$ is true and $P(5)$ is false, then $P(n)$ is either true or false.
- **axioms** are propositions that are simply accepted as true
- a **proof** is a sequence of logical deductions using axioms and other proved statements
- other terms for propositions
    - **theorems** are *important* true propositions
    - **lemmas** are preliminary propositions useful for proving later propositions
    - **corollaries** are propositions that [follow in a few logical steps from a theorem] — *correlating* to a theorem
- logical deductions are used to prove new propositions using previously proved propositions
