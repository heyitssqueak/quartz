# resources & deployment

- Big 3 categories of software:
    1. Analysis code -- running Python code once on some data to get results
    2. Application -- continuously running the code, like a website
    3. Systems -- how to manage resources such as storage space
- Systems resources:
    - compute -> CPU, GPU
        - CPUs can each have multiple cores, which can be independently executing "core code" (machine code)
        - More cores means that more tasks can be run simultaneously
        - High level code -> compiled to bytecode -> ran by a VM -> VM is running on a core
        - GPU has many cores that are coordinated and slow because they have to run together
        - Cost measurement: FLOPS (floating-point operations per second)
    - mem -> RAM
        - RAM stores bits
        - Small, volatile (lost upon reboot) and fast
    - storage -> HDD, SSD
        - Data read/written in blocks of many bytes/blocks
        - Large, nonvolatile, slow
        - How fast can be read/write data? This is measured in throughput
    - network -> NIC (network interface card)
        - Data access speed can be based on network topology -- which servers are physically closest
- How do we efficiently utilize the four above resources?
    1. Scale UP: get more mem/compute power
    2. Scale OUT: cluster machines (expensive)
