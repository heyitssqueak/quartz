## permutations and combinations
- $|S|$ denotes the number of elements in $S$, cardinality/size of $S$
- **Addition Principle:** $|S| = |S_1| + |S_2| + \dots + |S_n|$
	- $S$ is partitioned such that each element within $S$ shows exactly once within any one partition
	- Summing all partitions should always equal $|S|$
- **Multiplication Principle:** $|T_1\times T_2\times \dots T_k|=|T_1|\times|T_2|\times\dots |T_k|$
	- The *Cartesian product* of two sets is the set of $A \times B$ with ordered pairs $(a, b)$ where $a$ is from $A$ and $b$ is from $B$ -- $\{(a,b) | a\in A, b\in B\}$
- n-stage experiment describes how many subsets can be constructed from a set (?)
- **Subtraction Principle:** $|A|=|U|-|\bar A|$
	- Given two sets, $A$ and $U$, where $A \subseteq U$, the complement of $A$ in $U$ is all the elements in $U$ that are not in $A$ -- $\bar A=U-A=\{x|x\in U,x\notin A\}$
- **Division Principle:** $\text{number of subsets}=\frac{|S|}{\text{the cardinality of each subset}}$
	- We partition $|S|$ into subsets of equal size and want to figure out how many *distinct* arrangements exist
	- \*Divide total number of combinations by the size of each group
- A **permutation** is an ordered arrangement of elements without repetition
	- An $r$-permutation is an ordered arrangement of $r$ elements where $r$ is a number
- $n!=n(n-1)(n-2)\cdot\dots\cdot(2)(1)$ where $0!=1$; product of $n$ and all integers less than $n$
- $P(n,r)=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$ for positive integers $n$ and $r$ ***REVIEW***
	- $P(n,r)$ represents the number of $r$-permutations of an $n$ element 
	- Special cases: $P(n,1)=n$, $P(n,n)=n!$
