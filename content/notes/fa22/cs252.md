> The computer is not an electronic genius; on the contrary, if anything, it is an electronic idiot, doing exactly what we tell it to do. It has no mind of its own.

# lectures
## intro
- Main components of the computer:
	- Processor - CPU; memory - RAM; motherboard; GPU; cooling; power supply
	- Storage -- SSD, HDD, thumbdrives, hard drives
		- Remembers things after the power is turned off
	- Output devices -- displays, sound
	- Input devices -- keyboard, mice, touch
- CPU components:
	- Bus memory; control unit; memory (cache, register); ALU FPU; clock

## ch2: bits, data types, and operations
-   Devices inside the computer react to the presence/absence* of voltages, rather than the actual voltage values
    -   Presence of voltage is represented as 1, while absence is represented as 0 — these 1s and 0s are called **bits**
    -   *Not the absolute presence/absence, but differentiate between “close to” and “far from” a target voltage, ex: if I wanted 3 volts, then 2.6 volts would signify a 1 (close to 3 volts) and 0.2 volts would signify a 0 (far from 3 volts)
-   With $k$ bits, we can distinguish at most $2^k$ different values, by counting in binary
-   Unsigned integers can be represented using the **2’s complement integers** ~~which is just a fancier way of saying binary counting~~
    -   Each digit in a binary string represents 2 to the power of that digit multiplied by 0 or 1
        $00110 = 0\cdot2^4+0\cdot2^3+1\cdot2^2+1\cdot2^1+0\cdot2^0=6$
-   For signed integers, the leading value (on the left) signifies positive or negative — leading 0 is positive, leading 1 is negative
    -   $k$ bits can represent the range $[-2^{k-1}, 2^{k-1})$ where negative numbers are denoted by a leading 1
        -   Shortcut for $-A(A\ne0)$: flip all bits of $A$ and add 1
    -   The carry for the leading digit is always ignored (because adding 00001 and 11111 does not make sense to produce 100000 when working with signed digits)
-   **Arithmetic and logic unit (ALU)** takes two inputs and one output to add digits together
