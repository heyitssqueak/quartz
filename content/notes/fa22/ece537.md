## overview
- Internet -- network of networks
- Computer network structure can look like this: end device (phone) -> router -> Internet Service Provider (ISP) -> ?? -> server
	- Router can be wifi router or a cellular provider
		- Redirects connection on where to go next ...
	- ISP connect determines how good router connection is (and also your phone to the router)
- Any ~~link~~ connection between two devices can be wireless
- **TCP/IP protocol stack:** physical > link > network > transport > application
	- (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
	- An *application* level protocol could look like this: client (browser tab) -> ISP -> backbone/hall network (?) -> server
		- Nothing between client and server actually understand the information transferred -- this means applications are End-to-End protocol, only the end devices understand what's going on
	- Physical (layers) need *everyone* to understand the content that passes through (I think it's less private?)
	<!-- - Transport takes one layer to another?? probably e2e protocol -->
	- Network has protocols that define many stops/nodes (such as ISP, servers) but each stop/node only knows its own predecessor and successor, known as **routing layers**
		- Each node only cares about getting to the next node and doesn't affect other information being transferred
		- Network protocol is lower level than application/transport, so any changes on those protocols won't affect network protocol efficiency
	- Link layer protocol manages multiple devices talking to one service/router
		- No protocols with only link layer! always linked to physical 
		- Wifi/ethernet is link and physical
- Transport/application only need to be understood by end devices; link and physical protocol need to be understood by *all devices in the network*
- **OSI protocol stack:** physical > link > network > transport > session > presentation > application (industry standard)
