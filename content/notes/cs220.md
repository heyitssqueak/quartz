title: "CS 220: Data Programming I"
---
Self-paced course taken summer '22, linked [here](https://www.msyamkumar.com/cs220/s20/syllabus.html). Introductory data science programming using Python and focuses on analyzing data quickly and efficiently.

## introduction
- inputs: keyboard, mouse
- outputs: monitor, speaker
- devices attach to the computer via “ports” (USB)
- motherboard: main circuit and connects to other components with sockets and slots
- CPU, central processing unit
    - runs code (receives input, sends output)
    - runs on a clock, measured in Hz (ex. GHz is billions of ticks per second)
    - high speed CPU → hotter
    - computers have multiple CPUs
- RAM, random access memory
    - short term data storage
        - CPU sends to and from RAM
    - “volatile” - lose data when computer is powered off
    - one byte = one letter
- storage drives
    - HDD, hard disk drive
        - inexpensive, moving parts, slow
    - SSD, solid state drive
        - expensive, no moving parts, fast
    - stores data after computer shut down
- network: an extension or built-in card to the motherboard
    - NIC, network interface controller
        - provides communication to other machines + internet
    - wired = ethernet, wireless = wifi
    - server: computer waits for incoming requests which it responds to
    - client: program that sends requests to a server
- jupyter notebook runs and displays results of py code without needing to run it yourself


## the terminal

- you can connect to terminals located anywhere, such as connecting to a remote computer OR connecting to a personal computer
- shell helps navigate to program and run
- helpful shell commands    
    - `pwd` get working directory → current location
    - `man` opens manual pages for command
    - `<tab>` autocomplete
    - `<ctrl-C>` kill / exit
    - `<up arrow>` last used command
    - `<ctrl-R>` search used commands
    - `cd` open directory
        - `cd ..` go up a directory
        - `cd /` go to top directory
    - `ls` lists contents of current directory
    - `mkdir` makes new directory
    - `echo` repeat or copy
    - `cat` display contents of file
    - `mv [original] [destination]` move files
    - `cp [original] [destination]` copy files        
- pathname: the location of your file (windows: includes drive letter, filename, extension…)
    - absolute: always possible (complete path name to file)
    - relative: with respect to current location
    - working directory: current location
    - `..` navigates up a directory
    - `.` navigates into a directory
- arguments are inputs that come after the call of the program name
- use `>` to redirect output to a new file
- use `>>` to add output to a file


## programming

- interpreter: a program that translates human-legible code into machine-legible code
- editor: a program where you can write code
- jupyter notebook mixes code with other things like images, tables, documentation, etc
- ways to run python
    - `python` interactive, denoted by `>>>`
    - `python [program name]` script
    - `jupyter notebook` notebook
- python uses order of operations to simplify equations (parentheses, exponents, m/d, a/s)
    - negative and positive signs take precedence over m/d
    - logic operators come after comparison operators which come after math operators

- boolean operators
    - AND: true when both conditions are true (t/t), false otherwise (t/f, f/t, f/f)
    - OR: true when one condition is true (t/t, t/f, f/t), false otherwise (f/f)
    - NOT: true when the condition is false
        - evaluate: NOT(is it saturday?)
            - if (is it saturday?) is true, then the expression is false, i.e., it IS saturday
            - if (is it saturday?) is false, then the expression is true, i.e., it is NOT saturday

### ch1: the way of the program

- python uses symbols as *bitwise* operators and words as logic operators
    - `and` `or` are logic operators
    - `&` `|` are bitwise operators
        - convert arguments into binary before comparisons
- common types: int, float, string, boolean
- parsing is understanding structure and meaning in a language
    - formal language: specifically designed languages (like mathematical or molecular notation); means exactly what it says, unambiguous, less redundant/more concise
    - natural language: naturally-evolved language (like English); has idioms/metaphor, needs redundancy to make up for ambiguity
