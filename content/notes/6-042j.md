# proofs

## introduction to proofs

- a **proposition** is a statement that is either true or false
- the $::=$ means “equal by definition” and usually just $=$ is used
- you can’t check a claim about an infinite set by checking a finite set of elements
- symbols
    - $\forall$ for all
    - $\mathbb{N}$ nonnegative integers
    - $\in$ is in, is a member of, belongs to
    - $\mathbb{Z}^+$ positive integers

**Proposition.** $313(x^3+y^3)=z^3$ has no solution when $x$, $y$, $z \in\mathbb{Z}^+$.

This latter part can be read as “when $x$, $y$, $z$ are in the set of all positive integers” or simpler, there is no solution when $x$, $y$, $z$ are all positive. This proposition is false (but the counterexample has more than 1000 digits.)

- a **predicate** is a proposition whose truth depends on variables and is denoted by [a letter with a function-like notation], ex: “$n$ is a perfect square” depends on the value of the variable $n$
    - $P(n)::=$ “$n$ is the perfect square”, where we can say $P(4)$ is true and $P(5)$ is false, then $P(n)$ is either true or false.
- **axioms** are propositions that are simply accepted as true
- a **proof** is a sequence of logical deductions using axioms and other proved statements
- other terms for propositions
    - **theorems** are *important* true propositions
    - **lemmas** are preliminary propositions useful for proving later propositions
    - **corollaries** are propositions that [follow in a few logical steps from a theorem] — *correlating* to a theorem
- logical deductions are used to prove new propositions using previously proved propositions

*modus ponens*: a proof of $P$ combined with a proof of $P\text{ implies }Q$ is equivalent to a proof of $Q$

**Rule.**

$$
\frac{P,P\text{ implies }Q}{Q}
$$

- statements above the line are proved (called *antecedents*), and statements below the line are called *conclusions*
- propositions in the form of “if $P$, then $Q$” are called **implications**, and will often be rephrased to $P\text{ implies }Q$
    1. write “Assume $P$.”
    2. show that $Q$ logically follows

**Theorem.** $\text{If }0\le x\le2\text{, then }-x^3+4x+1\gt0.$

*Proof.*

$$
-x^3+4x=x(2-x)(2+x)
$$
$$
x(2-x)(2+x)+1\gt 0
$$
$$
-x^3+4x+1\gt 0
\tag*{$\blacksquare$}
$$

- proofs begin with the word “*Proof*” and end with “QED” or $\blacksquare$
- a **contrapositive** is when $P\text{ implies }Q$ is logically equivalent to $\text{not(}Q\text{) implies not(}P)$
    1. write “We prove the contrapositive:”
    2. write “Assume $\text{not }Q$” and show that $\text{not } P$ logically follows
- a theorem can assert that two statements are logically equivalent, that one holds if and only if the other holds — the shortened phrase being $\text{iff}$
    - saying that $P\text{ iff }Q$ is equivalent to saying $P\text{ implies }Q$ and $Q\text{ implies }P$
        1. write “We prove $P$ implies $Q$ and vice-versa.”
        2. show that $P$ implies $Q$ and show that $Q$ implies $P$
    - $\text{iff}$s can come in chains
        1. write “We construct a chain of if-and-only-if implications.”
        2. prove that $P$ is equivalent to a second statement which is equivalent to a third statement and a fourth statement and so forth until $Q$ is reached
