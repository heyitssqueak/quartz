[Project 2](http://emilyyao.me/report2.pdf): Analyzing TCP and UDP traffic behavior over wireless networks  
[Project 3](http://emilyyao.me/report3.pdf): Estimating VBR/CBR based on packet capture

# context
**ECE 537: Communication Networks**. Overview of the TCP/IP protocol stack. Large focus on application transport layer protocols, congestion detection and avoidance; brief introduction to wireless networks, addressing/routing/forwarding, and media streaming. 

# summary
For each project, I was given a broad outline of a topic I should write a report on. To help me write the report, I learned to use a variety of tools, including but not limited to Wireshark, iperf, rvictl, Linux Ubuntu, and [UTM](/utm-ubuntu) for creating VMs on the new silicon chip Apple laptops. I collected data on network traffic on campus and I go over this data in the reports.

# reflection
<!-- My biggest takeaway from this project is adaptability. Most of the tools I mentioned are specific to this kind of work and I had zero experience using them coming into these projects. Learning my way around these tools as I was working on an actual project showed me that I could learn as I go. 

I also found it interesting to be able to to collect data and observe processes that are part of a larger, ongoing network. I've only ever ran code in isolated projects which had no interaction with the world. I had full control over the environment and when issues came up, I could locate and fix the problem. This project was more about using tools to watch a network run, and if anomalies came up in my data, I couldn't just locate to the source of the error and fix it, I had to find work arounds.  -->



I believe that there is more to be done which could improve the quality of these reports. There are some siginificant errors in P2 which affected the average throughput measurements, and my measurements for TCP channels in P3 were outright wrong. I do briefly mention sources of error in P2, but overall I could have done a better job at acknowledging how my data was biased and correcting for it.

That being said, I don't believe I will revisit these projects as they are now. My primary takeaway from these reports was learning how to use Wireshark, understanding the packet/traffic flow graphs, and utilizing command line tools and scripts. Redoing these projects would not teach me as much as they did the first time around. 

However, I am interested in learning how to use Raspberry Pi and I recently learned that you can install Wireshark onto a Pi, so that might be something I'd work on in the future. (Edit: I was told this is basically the same thing as just running it on Linux or on a VM, so there's that...)
