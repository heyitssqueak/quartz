[Project 2](/report2.pdf): Analyzing TCP and UDP traffic behavior over wireless networks

[Project 3](/report3.pdf): Estimating VBR/CBR based on packet capture

# context
**ECE 537: Communication Networks, taught by Bhuvana Krishnaswamy @ UW-Madison**. Overview of the TCP/IP protocol stack. Large focus on application transport layer protocols, congestion detection and avoidance; brief introduction to wireless networks, addressing/routing/forwarding, and media streaming. 


# thoughts
I believe that there is more to be done which could improve the quality of these reports. There are some siginificant errors in P2 which affected the average throughput measurements, and my measurements for TCP channels in P3 were outright wrong.

That being said, I don't believe I will revisit these projects as they are now. My primary takeaway from these reports was learning how to use Wireshark, understanding the packet/traffic flow graphs, and utilizing command line tools and scripts. Redoing these projects would not teach me as much as they did the first time around. 

However, I am interested in learning how to use Raspberry Pi and I recently learned that you can install Wireshark onto a Pi, so that might be something I'd work on in the future.
