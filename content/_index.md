# hey, it's squeak!
Welcome to my pothole of the internet. I'm Emily! My nickname is "*squeak*" â€” from which most of my usernames on the web are derived. I'm currently a first-year at UW-Madison studying computer science, mathematics, and economic analytics. This summer I will be working at [Mandli Communications](https://www.mandli.com/) as an SWE intern!

My main hobby is puzzle-solving, which is where all my other interests stem from. I like combinatorial math and competitive coding, among other topics such as [computer networks](/ece537), robotics, image processing, and [low-level computing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/). In my free time, I enjoy [reading](https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/books), playing poker, and listening to [copyrighted Nintendo music](https://youtu.be/HL9_xm5HwrE).

I like meeting interesting people! If you want to say hi or grab lunch with me, send an email at `hello at emilyyao dot me`!
