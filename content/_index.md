## about
Welcome to my pothole on the Internet. I'm Emily! My nickname is "*squeak*" â€” from which most of my
usernames on the web are derived. I'm currently an undergraduate student at UW-Madison studying 
computer science, mathematics, and economics. Right now, I'm working as a system adminstrator intern
at the [Center for High-Throughput Computing](https://chtc.cs.wisc.edu/).

My main hobby is puzzle-solving, which is where all my other interests stem from -- I particularly 
enjoy competitive programming and coding games, such as [Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/) or [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) . My 
main areas of interest in computer science are computer networks and low-level systems, among other 
topics such as computer vision, compilers, and robotics. In terms of math, I'm primarily interested
in combinatorics, or more generally, probability theory. 

In my free time, I like [reading](https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/books), playing 
poker, and listening to [video game music](https://youtu.be/HL9_xm5HwrE). I also occasionally delve
into math-related projects and visualizations as a means to create my own mathematics teaching
style.

## contact
I like meeting interesting people -- if you want to say hi or grab lunch with me, send an email at 
`hello at emilyyao dot me`! If you're on campus, feel free to drop by during my 
[office hours](https://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/hours.html) at the Undergraduate Projects Lab.
