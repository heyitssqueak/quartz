# hey, it's squeak!
Welcome to my pothole of the internet. I'm Emily! My nickname is "*squeak*" â€” from which most of my usernames on the web are derived. I'm currently a first-year at UW-Madison studying CS/CompE. I'm primarily interested in robotics and machine learning, and applying these skills in a competition format. In my free time, I love reading historical fiction and listening to [copyrighted Nintendo music](https://youtu.be/HL9_xm5HwrE).

I like meeting interesting people! If you want to say hi, send me a message at `hello [at] emilyyao.me`!
