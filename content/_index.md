# hey, it's squeak.
Welcome to my pothole of the internet. I'm Emily! My nickname is "*squeak*" â€” from which most of my usernames on the web are derived. I'm currently a first-year at UW-Madison studying CS. I'm interested in robotics, machine learning, and internet privacy. In my free time, I love reading historical fiction and listening to [copyrighted Nintendo music](https://youtu.be/HL9_xm5HwrE).
