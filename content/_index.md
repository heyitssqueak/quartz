# hey, it's squeak!
Welcome to my pothole of the internet. I'm Emily! My nickname is "*squeak*" â€” from which most of my usernames on the web are derived. I'm currently a first-year at UW-Madison studying CS. Right now I'm on winter break working on a large list of projects I've accumulated over the semester.

My main hobby is puzzle-solving, which is where all my other interests stem from. I enjoy combinatorial math and competitive coding, among other topics like computer networking, robotics, and signal processing. In my free time, I like reading books from the [Booker Prize](https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/books) archive, binge-watching *Survivor*, and listening to [copyrighted Nintendo music](https://youtu.be/HL9_xm5HwrE).

I like meeting interesting people! If you want to say hi or grab lunch with me, send an email at `hello` `at` `emilyyao` `dot` `me`!

# ongoing
By no means a comprehensive list of what I'm working on:
- Newer, cooler websites
- Battlecode '23
- TCP/IP stack concept map
- LC-3 simulator
