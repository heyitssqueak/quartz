## about
Welcome to my pothole on the Internet. I'm Emily! My nickname is "*squeak*" â€” from which most of my usernames on the web are derived. I'm currently an undergraduate [student](/academics) at UW-Madison studying computer science, mathematics, and economics. Right now, I'm working as a consulting engineer intern in Research Triangle Park, NC at [Cisco](https://www.cisco.com/).

My main hobby is puzzle-solving, which is where all my other interests stem from -- I particularly enjoy competitive programming and coding [games](/projects#contests), such as [Battlecode](https://battlecode.org/) or [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). My main areas of interest in computer science are in low-level systems like compilers and programming languages, among other topics such as computer networks, optimization, and robotics. In terms of math, I'm primarily interested in combinatorics, or more generally, probability theory. 

In my free time, I like [reading](https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/books), playing poker, and listening to [video game music](https://youtu.be/HL9_xm5HwrE). I also occasionally delve into math-related projects and visualizations as a means to create my own mathematics teaching style.

## contact
I like meeting interesting people -- if you want to say hi or grab lunch with me, send an email at `hello at emilyyao dot me`! If you're on campus, feel free to drop by during [office hours](https://www.upl.cs.wisc.edu/hours/) at the Undergraduate Projects Lab.
