# hey, it's squeak!
Welcome to my pothole of the internet. I'm Emily! My nickname is "*squeak*" â€” from which most of my usernames on the web are derived. I'm currently a first-year at UW-Madison studying CS. I'm interested in puzzles and robotics, among various other topics like computer networks, competitive coding, and digital privacy. In my free time, I like listening to audiobooks and [copyrighted Nintendo music](https://youtu.be/HL9_xm5HwrE).

I like meeting interesting people! If you want to say hi or grab lunch with me, send a message at `hello` `at` `emilyyao` `dot` `me`!
