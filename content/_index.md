# hey, it's squeak!
Welcome to my pothole on the Internet. I'm Emily! My nickname is "*squeak*" â€” from which most of my usernames on the web are derived. I'm currently an undergraduate student at UW-Madison studying computer science, mathematics, and economics. This summer I am working at [Mandli Communications](https://www.mandli.com/) as an SWE intern!

My main hobby is puzzle-solving, which is where all my other interests stem from. I particularly enjoy competitive coding, among other computer science topics such as [computer networks](/ece537), image processing, robotics, and [low-level computing](https://store.steampowered.com/app/370360/TIS100/). In terms of math, my favorite subject is combinatorics, followed closely by probability theory and stochastic processes. In my free time, I like [reading](https://thebookerprizes.com/the-booker-library/books), playing poker, and listening to [video game music](https://youtu.be/HL9_xm5HwrE).

I like meeting interesting people -- if you want to say hi or grab lunch with me, send an email at `hello at emilyyao dot me`!
