This summer is an ideal place to start -- just after high school and before college, where I have enough agency to achieve my goals, without too much academic stress. I'm drawing motivation from this saying: \n\n\u003e Most people overestimate what they can do in a day, but underestimate what they can do in a year.\n\nMy goals are the following:\n- Learn about topics that I think I would enjoy\n- Work on some small projects\n- Build healthy habits\n- Read more, write more\n- Enjoy that summer sun\n\nThey are vague on purpose -- I'll have plenty of options that accomplish these tasks without feeling restricted to a particular path.\n\n## starting point\n### online classes\nBefore the fall semester starts, I want to do a bit of learning on my own. For the most part, I'm going to be reviewing old classes (linear algebra, data structures / algorithms) and exploring new classes (discrete math, artificial intelligence, signals and systems). This is for me to \"test the waters\" and try out things that are interesting to me.\n\n### cool projects\nI'm interested in making something for 3Blue1Brown's [Summer of Math Exposition #2 (SoME2)](https://youtu.be/hZuYICAEN9Y). I'm not particularly sure what knowledge I have to offer but I'm planning on something within the computer science or signal processing realm. \n\nI've also been interested in cybersecurity for the past few months, but never got around to actually learning more about it. Since I have more time now, I want to take advantage of some resources like [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.com), [OverTheWire: Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/), the [DEF CON CTF archive](https://archive.ooo/) to help me learn more. At the beginning of this year, my goal was to participate in the DEF CON 30 CTF qualifiers, but that has since passed -- my new goal is to take a shot at next year's qualifiers, but we'll see about that...\n\nAmong other things, I want to clean up my website better and get my wiki space set up.\n\n## plan\nMy next update will be in two weeks. For the most part, I want to see where things will take me, so I don't really have a concrete schedule.","lastmodified":"2022-06-26T21:34:40.057378599Z","tags":null},"/2022-sea2":{"title":"Summer Exploration Arc #2","content":"## recap\nI made a [post](/2022-sea1.md) two weeks ago where I wrote about what I wanted to accomplish in my free time this summer. This is my first progress update.\n\nMy focus has primarily been on settling into a good routine where I can balance work and learning in my downtime. I teach summer camps in the morning which has helped me build a solid morning routine. I have plenty of free time in the afternoons, which I've been trying to put towards doing something useful.\n\n## progress\n### academics\nHistorically, I don't have a good track record when it comes to self-paced online courses -- I struggle a lot with finding an interesting yet not-too-difficult class. So far I've tried and dropped Caltech's [Learning From Data](https://work.caltech.edu/telecourse) course because I didn't understand how to do the homeworks -- the answers were in Python, and I don't know Python. I also gave MIT's [18.06SC: Linear Algebra](https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:OCW+18.06SC+2T2019/about) a shot, but it's moving along very slowly. I think my hesitancy with this class comes from how I'm not confident at writing proofs. While I enjoy Gilbert Strang's lectures, I blank when it comes to applying new concepts on my own.\n\nGoing back to how I don't know Python: it's been on my todo list for a long time. I never got around to actually *learning* Python, and most of my prior experience came from doing beginner [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems. I did find a course that I've been working through [(CS 220 from UW-Madison)](http://msyamkumar.com/cs220/s20/schedule.html) and I'm about 1/3 of the way through. This has been my main focus for the past week as I've settled into this whole summer exploration thing.\n\n### cybersecurity\nLast week I managed to set up Kali Linux on my laptop after a bit of fiddling around. I'm not sure what I intend to do with it -- so far I've just been trying out the [Linux Fundamentals](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/linux-fundamentals) course on [HTB Academy](https://academy.hackthebox.com/). I want to get more familiar with using terminal and other command line tools. I also plan to finish a cybersecurity certificate I started a long time ago.\n\n### website\nAfter my last post, I spent a while working on my wiki website which is live now at [wiki.emilyyao.me](https://wiki.emilyyao.me). There are still a few things I need to work out (such as the side TOC being wonky on mobile) but it's a good start. I want to use somehow organize my notes and ramblings into comprehensive pages soon. This project will probably take a while until it is presentable. My main goal is to consistently update this during the school year and create something that can help other people, too.\n\n### \"Enjoy that summer sun\"\nI am sunburnt\n\n### misc\n- [my Taiko addiction](https://youtu.be/QbPj5vfprIQ)\n- Current reads: *Homegoing* by Yaa Gyasi; *Normal People* by Sally Rooney\n\n## plan\nMy first goal is to finish the CS 220 course which might take a bit longer than two weeks. I'd also like to finish both of the books I'm currently reading. Other side goals include: finishing the Linux course with HTB, cleaning up my old calculus notes on my wiki, and exiting my house to do something other than drive to work.","lastmodified":"2022-06-26T21:34:40.057378599Z","tags":null},"/academics":{"title":"Notes","content":"This branch (`emilyyao.me/notes/`) is used for freehand/spontaneous notes that I take in class.

Introductory data science programming using Python, focusing on analyzing data quickly and efficiently. Texts used include Allen B. Downey's *Think Python, 2nd Edition* and Al Sweigart's *Automate the Boring Stuff*.\n\n## introduction\n- inputs: keyboard, mouse\n- outputs: monitor, speaker\n- devices attach to the computer via ‚Äúports‚Äù (USB)\n- motherboard: main circuit and connects to other components with sockets and slots\n- CPU, central processing unit\n    - runs code (receives input, sends output)\n    - runs on a clock, measured in Hz (ex. GHz is billions of ticks per second)\n    - high speed CPU ‚Üí hotter\n    - computers have multiple CPUs\n- RAM, random access memory\n    - short term data storage\n        - CPU sends to and from RAM\n    - ‚Äúvolatile‚Äù - lose data when computer is powered off\n    - one byte = one letter\n- storage drives\n    - HDD, hard disk drive\n        - inexpensive, moving parts, slow\n    - SSD, solid state drive\n        - expensive, no moving parts, fast\n    - stores data after computer shut down\n- network: an extension or built-in card to the motherboard\n    - NIC, network interface controller\n        - provides communication to other machines + internet\n    - wired = ethernet, wireless = wifi\n    - server: computer waits for incoming requests which it responds to\n    - client: program that sends requests to a server\n- jupyter notebook runs and displays results of py code without needing to run it yourself\n\n---\n\n## the terminal\n\n- you can connect to terminals located anywhere, such as connecting to a remote computer OR connecting to a personal computer\n- shell helps navigate to program and run\n- helpful shell commands    \n    - `pwd` get working directory ‚Üí current location\n    - `man` opens manual pages for command\n    - `\u003ctab\u003e` autocomplete\n    - `\u003cctrl-C\u003e` kill / exit\n    - `\u003cup arrow\u003e` last used command\n    - `\u003cctrl-R\u003e` search used commands\n    - `cd` open directory\n        - `cd ..` go up a directory\n        - `cd /` go to top directory\n    - `ls` lists contents of current directory\n    - `mkdir` makes new directory\n    - `echo` repeat or copy\n    - `cat` display contents of file\n    - `mv [original] [destination]` move files\n    - `cp [original] [destination]` copy files        \n- pathname: the location of your file (windows: includes drive letter, filename, extension‚Ä¶)\n    - absolute: always possible (complete path name to file)\n    - relative: with respect to current location\n    - working directory: current location\n    - `..` navigates up a directory\n    - `.` navigates into a directory\n- arguments are inputs that come after the call of the program name\n- use `\u003e` to redirect output to a new file\n- use `\u003e\u003e` to add output to a file\n\n---\n\n## programming\n\n- interpreter: a program that translates human-legible code into machine-legible code\n- editor: a program where you can write code\n- jupyter notebook mixes code with other things like images, tables, documentation, etc\n- ways to run python\n    - `python` interactive, denoted by `\u003e\u003e\u003e`\n    - `python [program name]` script\n    - `jupyter notebook` notebook\n- python uses order of operations to simplify equations (parentheses, exponents, m/d, a/s)\n    - negative and positive signs take precedence over m/d\n    - logic operators come after comparison operators which come after math operators\n\n![diagram](/images/operator-precedence.png)\n\n- boolean operators\n    - AND: true when both conditions are true (t/t), false otherwise (t/f, f/t, f/f)\n    - OR: true when one condition is true (t/t, t/f, f/t), false otherwise (f/f)\n    - NOT: true when the condition is false\n        - evaluate: NOT(is it saturday?)\n            - if (is it saturday?) is true, then the expression is false, i.e., it IS saturday\n            - if (is it saturday?) is false, then the expression is true, i.e., it is NOT saturday\n\n### downey ch1: the way of the program\n\n- python uses symbols as *bitwise* operators and words as logic operators\n    - `and` `or` are logic operators\n    - `\u0026` `|` are bitwise operators\n        - convert arguments into binary before comparisons\n- common types: int, float, string, boolean\n- parsing is understanding structure and meaning in a language\n    - formal language: specifically designed languages (like mathematical or molecular notation); means exactly what it says, unambiguous, less redundant/more concise\n    - natural language: naturally-evolved language (like English); has idioms/metaphor, needs redundancy to make up for ambiguity\n\n---\n\n## variables and expressions\n\n- expressions are a mix of operators (logic, mathematical) and operands (values)\n    - an operand *could* be a variable which means it won‚Äôt be a fixed value\n    - `//` is the floor division operator: `x // y` is ‚Äúhow many times does `y` go into `x`?\n- assignments compute an expression and put the result in a variable ‚Äî assignment operator is `=`\n    - ex: `total = x+y` where `total` is the resultant variable; `x` and `y` are operands (and also variables); `x+y` is the expression\n- types of errors\n    - syntax error: the written code is wrong, Python won‚Äôt run, ex: `5 = x`, we can‚Äôt assign `x` to the number `5`\n    - runtime errors: something that crashes when we run the code, ex: `x = 5 / 0`, can‚Äôt divide by zero and will result in a `ZeroDivisionError`\n    - semantic (logic) error: the code runs but you don‚Äôt get the result you want\n- python variable naming conventions\n    - don‚Äôt use keywords\n        |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | \n        | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n        | False | assert | del | for | in | or | while |\n        | None | break | elif | from | is | pass | with |\n        | True | class | else | global | lambda | raise | yield |\n        | and | continue | except | if | nonlocal | return |  |\n        | as | def | finally | import | not | try |  |\n    - don‚Äôt name your variable after a type, like `int` or `str`\n    - only use letters (upper + lower), numbers, underscores\n        - don‚Äôt start the variable name with a number\n    \n    | examples | nonexamples |\n    | --- | --- |\n    | CS220 | 220class |\n    | cs_220 | x! |\n    | _cs220 | pi3.14 |\n\n### downey ch2: variables, expressions and statements\n\n- python conventionally uses lowercase and underscores for variable names\n    - illegal names will cause syntax errors\n- python code can be saved into files called *scripts* which end with `.py`\n- `print()` needs to be used in script mode if you want to display outputs\n- PEMDAS is helpful for remembering the order of operation for expressions\n    - **P**arentheses, **E**xponents, **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision, **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction\n- can‚Äôt perform mathematical operations on strings but we *can* add strings together (called string concatenation)\n    ```python\n    first = 'throat'\n    second = 'warbler'\n    print(first + second)\n    \u003e throatwarbler\n    ```\n- strings can also be multiplied, ex: `'Spam'*3` is `'SpamSpamSpam'`\n- comments are lines that the computer will ignore ‚Äî used to make notes between lines of code for humans to read\n    ```python\n    # compute percentage of an hour\n    percentage = (minute * 100) / 60\n    ```\n    - everything on the line with the `#` symbol is ignored\n    - usually used to denote things that aren‚Äôt obvious to the reader ‚Äî meanings of variables, functions\n- syntax errors appear *before* the program is run; runtime errors appear *after* the program has run; semantic errors don‚Äôt appear at all\n\n---\n\n## using functions\n\n- functions are ‚Äúmini-programs‚Äù or small steps that can build a big program\n- refactoring is when the code is reorganized\n- **parameters** are variables that receive a function‚Äôs input\n- **arguments** are values that are sent to a function\n    - default arguments are values that are sent to the function *if* no custom value is provided\n- **return values** are outputs from the function\n\n![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/67c58043-cd64-44c3-8674-953c2dd46f0b/Untitled.png)\n\n- calling a function in python: `[fnc name]([arguments])` ex: `print(\"hello\")` where `print` is the function name, followed by parentheses, and `\"hello\"` is the argument\n\n### downey ch3: functions\n\n- **function** - a named sequence that performs a computation\n- python has *modules* which are prewritten code that you can use in your program by importing\n    - ex: functions from the math module can be used after importing it with `import math`, including `math.sin()`, `math.log10(), etc`\n- functions can be called using *dot notation* which is the format `[module name].[function name]`\n- variables are always on the left side of an assignment operator\n\n---\n\n## creating functions\n\n- math to python example\n    $f(x)=x^2$\n    `def f(x):\n        return x ** 2`\n    - both functions are called `f` and take a parameter, `x`, and return the value of `x` squared\n- indentation is important in python!\n    - following the colon after the first line of a function, all following lines are indented 4 spaces\n- filling parameters\n    - positional arguments ‚Äî arguments assigned by position\n        ```python\n        def foo(x, y = -1):\n            x = [] # this would be 99, because 99 is the first arg\n    \t    y = [] # this would be 100\n\n        foo(99, 100)\n        ```\n    - keyword arguments ‚Äî arguments assigned to variable names\n        ```python\n        def foo(x, y = -1):\n            x = [] # this would be 100 because we said x=100 below\n            y = [] # this would be 99\n        \n        foo(y=99, x=100)\n        ```\n    - default arguments ‚Äî inserted arguments if nothing is provided\n        ```python\n        def foo(x, y = -1):\n            x = [] # this would be 99 \n            y = [] # this would be -1 because we specified it above\n        \n        foo(99)\n        ```\n- `return` will provide code to the program that can be used later, while `print()` will output the code to a terminal\n\n### downey ch3 (cont.): functions\n\n- custom functions can be added by using the keyword `def`\n    - the **header** of the function is the first line, while the **body** **(indented 4 spaces) is the rest of the function\n- if the parentheses after the function name are empty, that means the function doesn‚Äôt take any arguments\n    ```python\n    def foo():\n        print(36)\n    \n    foo()\n    \u003e 36\n    ```\n- functions have to be created before they can be called ‚Üí function definitions are always at the top of a program\n    - execution begins at the top of the program and moves down\n- *fruitful functions* return values; *void functions* don‚Äôt return anything\n    - usually want to perform an action with the output of a fruitful function\n\n### reading: creating fruitful functions\n\n- to send a value to a variable instead of printing it to a screen, we can use the `return` keyword ‚Üí is called a fruitful function\n    - result is stored in a variable and can be used again\n    ```python\n    # using print\n    def get_name(first, last):\n        print(first + \" \" + last)\n    \n    name = get_name(\"Jane\", \"Doe\")\n    \u003e \"Jane Doe\"\n    \n    print(name)\n    \u003e None # nothing is assigned to 'name' so it has the None type\n    ```  \n    $\\phantom{-}$\n    ```python\n    # using return\n    def get_name(first, last):\n        return(first + \" \" + last)\n    \n    name = get_name(\"Jane\", \"Doe\") # nothing prints because there is no print statement\n    \n    print(name)\n    \u003e \"Jane Doe\" # the name is returned through the function\n    ```\n- once a `return` statement is reached, the function ends\n    ```python\n    # using print()\n    def countdown_print():\n        print(3)\n        print(2)\n        print(1)\n    \n    countdown_print()\n    \u003e 3\n    \u003e 2\n    \u003e 1\n    ```\n    $\\phantom{-}$\n    ```python\n    # using return\n    def countdown_return():\n        return 3\n        return 2\n        return 1\n    \n    countdown_return()\n    \u003e 3\n    ```\n- `__builtins__` is a special module that is already imported\n- `dir()` lists all functions that are part of a module\n- `.__doc__` returns the documentation of a function\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    print(math.log.__doc__) # [module name].[function name].__doc__\n    \u003e log(x, [base=math.e])\n    \u003e Return the logarithm of x to the given value\n    ```\n\n---\n\n## function scope\n\n- variable names can be organized in *frames*\n- **frames** are created when a function is called ‚Äî parameters and variables exist in the frame (also called scope?)\n    ```python\n    def print_twice(s): # function frame\n        print(s)\n        print(s)\n    \n    def cat_twice(p1, p2): # different function frame\n        cat = p1 + p2\n        print_twice(cat)\n    \n    line1 = \"bing bong\" # lies in the global frame\n    line2 = \"bong bing\" # lies in the global frame\n    cat_twice(line1, line2)\n    ```\n    - the module can access two variables: `line1` and `line2`\n    - `cat_twice()` accesses three variables: `p1` (which is `line1` passed through the function), `p2` (which is `line2` passed through the function), and `cat`\n    - `print_twice()` only accesses one variable: `s` which is `cat` passed through\n- local variables\n    - functions don‚Äôt execute unless they‚Äôre called\n        ```python\n        def set_x():\n            x = 100\n        \n        print(x)\n        # doesn't print anything because set_x() wasn't called\n        ```\n    - variables created in a function die after the function returns\n        ```python\n        def set_x():\n            x = 100\n        \n        set_x()\n        print(x)\n        # doesn't print because x doesn't exist after the end of the function\n        ```\n    - variables are reset every time a function is called\n    - variables aren‚Äôt shared across functions\n        ```python\n        def display():\n            print(x)\n        \n        def main():\n            x = 100\n            display()\n        \n        main()\n        ```\n        - even though `x` is set to be `100` in the `main()` function, the `display()` function can‚Äôt see the `x` value and it doesn‚Äôt print anything\n- global variables can be used inside functions\n    - python assumes any variables assigned within functions are *local variables*\n        ```python\n        msg = \"hello\"\n        \n        def greeting():\n            msg = \"welcome!\" # local variable, only present within the function\n            print(\"greeting: \" + msg)\n        \n        print(\"before: \" + msg) \n        greeting()\n        print(\"after: \" + msg)\n        \n        \u003e before: hello\n        \u003e greeting: welcome!\n        \u003e after: hello\n        ```\n- use `global [var name]` to declare when to create a global variable\n    ```python\n    msg = \"hello\"\n    \n    def greeting():\n        global msgd\n        msg = \"welcome!\" # local variable, only present within the function\n        print(\"greeting: \" + msg)\n    \n    print(\"before: \" + msg) \n    greeting()\n    print(\"after: \" + msg)\n    \n    \u003e before: hello\n    \u003e greeting: welcome!\n    \u003e after: welcome!\n    ```\n- python arguments are ‚Äúpassed by value‚Äù meaning any change to an argument that happens inside a function does *not* apply to that variable outside of the function\n- the argument and parameter can have the same (or different) name\n\n### downey ch3 (cont.): functions\n\n- inside a function, arguments are assigned to variables called *parameters*\n- variables created inside functions exist only in that function\n- a **traceback** is a list of functions that details what file, line, and functions caused an error\n- usefulness of functions\n    - repetitive code can be named and grouped, which makes debugging easier\n    - reusuable\n- Linux started out as a program that would switch between printing `AAAA` and `BBBB`\n\n---\n\n## conditionals 1\n- statements are always executed in order, with three exceptions: functions, conditionals, and loops\n- indented lines = ‚Äúinside‚Äù functions\n- questions are often phrased as boolean expressions, while actions are written as statements\n- control flow diagrams are flowcharts for code ‚Äî visual representation of how the code should run\n    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/731bde24-deba-4995-813f-af455a4b9909/Untitled.png)\n- a boolean expression uses the `if` keyword and sometimes uses `else` if there are multiple solutions\n    ```python\n    if [boolean expression == True]:\n        # execute code\n    else: # implying that boolean expression == False\n        # execute different code\n    ```\n- *blocks* of code are defined by indentations (which come with colons)\n\n### downey ch4: case study: interface design\n\n- the `turtle` module in python allows you to create images with turtle graphics\n    - basically, it‚Äôs a little ‚Äúturtle‚Äù that you can control using commands (move forward, turn left) to draw stuff\n- `for` loops can be used to repeat pieces of code\n    ```python\n    for i in range(4):\n        print(i + \"hello!\")\n    \n    \u003e 0 hello!\n    \u003e 1 hello!\n    \u003e 2 hello!\n    \u003e 3 hello!\n    ```\n    - the `i` is a counter variable ‚Äî starting at 0, it will increase by 1 every loop\n    - `4` is the number of times the loop will repeat\n- **encapsulation** is when you wrap up code in a function\n    - this gives the code a name, which serves as documentation (noting what its purpose is)\n- **generalization** is adding parameters to a function to make it more ‚Äúcustomizable‚Äù, ex: creating a function that draws a square of *any* size instead of just 1 size\n- the **interface** of a function is a summary of how the function is used, including parameters, purpose, return values\n    - a good interface achieves its purpose without needing to provide unnecessary information\n- **refactoring** is the process of rearranging a program to improve interfaces ‚Äî the goal is to make the code more readable and still be useful\n- **docstrings** are strings at the top of a function that explains the interface (basically describes the purpose of the function)\n    - doc = documentation\n    - also called headers or javadoc comments in Java\n    - all docstrings are *triple-quoted*\n    ```python\n    def polyline(t, n, length, angle):\n        \"\"\"Draws n line segments with the given length and angle (in degrees) between them. t is a turtle.\"\"\"\n        for i in rage(n):\n            t.fd(length)\n            t.lt(angle)\n    ```\n- **preconditions** are things that are required to be true *before* the start of a function, ex: the `angle` parameter has to be a positive value\n- **postconditions** are conditions at the end of the function\n    - if the postconditions are wrong but the preconditions are satisfied, then the bug is within the function\n\n### downey ch5: conditionals ~~and recursion~~\n\n- the **floor division operator** (`//`) divides two numbers and returns the integer (rounds down), ex: `5 // 3 = 1`\n- the **modulus operator** (`%`) divides two numbers and returns the remainder, ex: `5 % 3 = 2`\n- a **boolean expression** will evaluate to either `True` or `False` and uses the `==` operator\n    - `!=` not equal to\n    - `\u003e` greater than\n    - `\u003c` less than\n    - `\u003e=` greater than or equal to\n    - `\u003c=` less than or equal to\n- **logical operators**: `and` `or` `not`\n- `if` statements are *conditional* statements, which check conditions\n    ```python\n    if x \u003e 0: \n        print(\"x is positive\")\n    ```\n    - if there is more than one possibility of the conditional statement, `else` clauses can be added\n        ```python\n        if x \u003e 0:\n            print(\"x is positive\")\n        else: \n            print(\"x is negative\")\n        ```\n    - if there are more than *two* possibilities, use `elif` to define other conditions\n        ```python\n        if x \u003e 0: \n            print(\"x is positive\")\n        elif x \u003c 0:\n            print(\"x is negative\")\n        else: \n            print(\"x is 0\")\n        ```\n- conditionals can also be nested inside each other ‚Äî the next example is a re-write of the previous one\n    ```python\n    if x \u003e 0:\n        print(\"x is positive\")\n    else:\n        if x \u003c 0:\n            print(\"x is negative\")\n        else:\n            print(\"x is 0\")\n    ```\n\n### downey ch6: fruitful functions\n\n- return values are usually assigned to variables or used in an expression\n    - if conditional statements are used, there can be multiple return statements ‚Äî it‚Äôs good practice to make sure the program can return a value no matter which path it takes\n- code that appears *after* a return statement is called **dead code** because it will never be executed\n- **incremental development** is the process of adding and debugging code in small chunks as to avoid long/complicated debugging sessions\n    - comments or tester pieces of code are called **scaffolding** which can be helpful for debugging, but aren‚Äôt part of the final product\n    - start with a working program and make small changes\n    - display intermediate values\n    - remove scaffolding to make code easier to read\n- one function can be called from within another\n- functions can return booleans\n    - common for the function name to be a yes/no question, like `is_even()`, `is_raining()`, or `is_divisible()`\n\n---\n\n## iteration 1\n\n- control flow diagram for a `while` loop\n    ![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/4a1a4c52-ec6f-4480-8058-7ff5ee2afad7/Untitled.png)\n- basic code for a `while` loop\n    ```python\n    while [condition]:\n        # execute code\n    ```\n\n### ch7: iteration\n\n- **reassignment** is when an existing variable is updated to have a new value\n    - equality in python (and other languages) isn‚Äôt achieved through the `=` operator, ex: saying `a = 3` and `a = b` does not mean `b = 3`\n- an **update** is a specific type of reassignment where the new value is dependent on the old value\n    - **increments** are when a variable is updated by adding 1, **decrements** are when a variable is updated by subtracting 1\n- a variable has to be initialized (it has to exist) before it can be updated\n- repetition can be called **iteration**\n- `while` loops will execute as long as the condition remains true after each iteration\n    ```python\n    while n \u003e 0: # while n is greater than 0, display and decrement n\n        print(n)\n        n = n - 1\n    print(\"Blastoff!\")\n    ```\n    - an **infinite loop** is a loop that repeats forever, and occurs when there is no way for the condition to evaluate as false\n- `break` statements can be used to exit loops in the middle rather than at the beginning or end\n- an **algorithm** is a mechanical process for solving problems\n\n---\n\n## iteration 2\n\n- to repeat a loop `n` times, either use `i = 1` and `i \u003c= n` OR `i = 0` and `i \u003c n` because python starts counting from 0 and not 1\n- `break` immediately exits a loop, just like how `return` will immediately exit a function\n- the keyword `continue` will stop the *current iteration* and checks the condition to begin the next iteration\n- loops can be nested\n\n### sweigart ch2: flow control\n\ntodo","lastmodified":"2022-06-26T21:34:40.061378607Z","tags":null},"/stream":{"title":"Stream","content":"This serves as a hub for all of my recent edits on my website.
