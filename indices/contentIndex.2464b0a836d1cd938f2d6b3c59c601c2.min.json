This summer is an ideal place to start -- just after high school and before college, where I have enough agency to achieve my goals, without too much academic stress. I'm drawing motivation from this saying: \n\n\u003e Most people overestimate what they can do in a day, but underestimate what they can do in a year.\n\nMy goals are the following:\n- Learn about topics that I think I would enjoy\n- Work on some small projects\n- Build healthy habits\n- Read more, write more\n- Enjoy that summer sun\n\nThey are vague on purpose -- I'll have plenty of options that accomplish these tasks without feeling restricted to a particular path.\n\n## starting point\n### online classes\nBefore the fall semester starts, I want to do a bit of learning on my own. For the most part, I'm going to be reviewing old classes (linear algebra, data structures / algorithms) and exploring new classes (discrete math, artificial intelligence, signals and systems). This is for me to \"test the waters\" and try out things that are interesting to me.\n\n### cool projects\nI'm interested in making something for 3Blue1Brown's [Summer of Math Exposition #2 (SoME2)](https://youtu.be/hZuYICAEN9Y). I'm not particularly sure what knowledge I have to offer but I'm planning on something within the computer science or signal processing realm. \n\nI've also been interested in cybersecurity for the past few months, but never got around to actually learning more about it. Since I have more time now, I want to take advantage of some resources like [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.com), [OverTheWire: Wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/), the [DEF CON CTF archive](https://archive.ooo/) to help me learn more. At the beginning of this year, my goal was to participate in the DEF CON 30 CTF qualifiers, but that has since passed -- my new goal is to take a shot at next year's qualifiers, but we'll see about that...\n\nAmong other things, I want to clean up my website better and get my wiki space set up.\n\n## plan\nMy next update will be in two weeks. For the most part, I want to see where things will take me, so I don't really have a concrete schedule.","lastmodified":"2022-06-24T03:23:56.138987046Z","tags":null},"/academics":{"title":"Notes","content":"This branch (`emilyyao.me/notes/`) is used for freehand/spontaneous notes that I take in class.

Introductory data science programming using Python focusing on analyzing data quickly and efficiently.\n\n## introduction\n- inputs: keyboard, mouse\n- outputs: monitor, speaker\n- devices attach to the computer via ‚Äúports‚Äù (USB)\n- motherboard: main circuit and connects to other components with sockets and slots\n- CPU, central processing unit\n    - runs code (receives input, sends output)\n    - runs on a clock, measured in Hz (ex. GHz is billions of ticks per second)\n    - high speed CPU ‚Üí hotter\n    - computers have multiple CPUs\n- RAM, random access memory\n    - short term data storage\n        - CPU sends to and from RAM\n    - ‚Äúvolatile‚Äù - lose data when computer is powered off\n    - one byte = one letter\n- storage drives\n    - HDD, hard disk drive\n        - inexpensive, moving parts, slow\n    - SSD, solid state drive\n        - expensive, no moving parts, fast\n    - stores data after computer shut down\n- network: an extension or built-in card to the motherboard\n    - NIC, network interface controller\n        - provides communication to other machines + internet\n    - wired = ethernet, wireless = wifi\n    - server: computer waits for incoming requests which it responds to\n    - client: program that sends requests to a server\n- jupyter notebook runs and displays results of py code without needing to run it yourself\n\n---\n\n## the terminal\n\n- you can connect to terminals located anywhere, such as connecting to a remote computer OR connecting to a personal computer\n- shell helps navigate to program and run\n- helpful shell commands    \n    - `pwd` get working directory ‚Üí current location\n    - `man` opens manual pages for command\n    - `\u003ctab\u003e` autocomplete\n    - `\u003cctrl-C\u003e` kill / exit\n    - `\u003cup arrow\u003e` last used command\n    - `\u003cctrl-R\u003e` search used commands\n    - `cd` open directory\n        - `cd ..` go up a directory\n        - `cd /` go to top directory\n    - `ls` lists contents of current directory\n    - `mkdir` makes new directory\n    - `echo` repeat or copy\n    - `cat` display contents of file\n    - `mv [original] [destination]` move files\n    - `cp [original] [destination]` copy files        \n- pathname: the location of your file (windows: includes drive letter, filename, extension‚Ä¶)\n    - absolute: always possible (complete path name to file)\n    - relative: with respect to current location\n    - working directory: current location\n    - `..` navigates up a directory\n    - `.` navigates into a directory\n- arguments are inputs that come after the call of the program name\n- use `\u003e` to redirect output to a new file\n- use `\u003e\u003e` to add output to a file\n\n---\n\n## programming\n\n- interpreter: a program that translates human-legible code into machine-legible code\n- editor: a program where you can write code\n- jupyter notebook mixes code with other things like images, tables, documentation, etc\n- ways to run python\n    - `python` interactive, denoted by `\u003e\u003e\u003e`\n    - `python [program name]` script\n    - `jupyter notebook` notebook\n- python uses order of operations to simplify equations (parentheses, exponents, m/d, a/s)\n    - negative and positive signs take precedence over m/d\n    - logic operators come after comparison operators which come after math operators\n\n![diagram](/images/operator-precedence.png)\n\n- boolean operators\n    - AND: true when both conditions are true (t/t), false otherwise (t/f, f/t, f/f)\n    - OR: true when one condition is true (t/t, t/f, f/t), false otherwise (f/f)\n    - NOT: true when the condition is false\n        - evaluate: NOT(is it saturday?)\n            - if (is it saturday?) is true, then the expression is false, i.e., it IS saturday\n            - if (is it saturday?) is false, then the expression is true, i.e., it is NOT saturday\n\n### ch1: the way of the program\n\n- python uses symbols as *bitwise* operators and words as logic operators\n    - `and` `or` are logic operators\n    - `\u0026` `|` are bitwise operators\n        - convert arguments into binary before comparisons\n- common types: int, float, string, boolean\n- parsing is understanding structure and meaning in a language\n    - formal language: specifically designed languages (like mathematical or molecular notation); means exactly what it says, unambiguous, less redundant/more concise\n    - natural language: naturally-evolved language (like English); has idioms/metaphor, needs redundancy to make up for ambiguity\n\n---\n\n## variables and expressions\n\n- expressions are a mix of operators (logic, mathematical) and operands (values)\n    - an operand *could* be a variable which means it won‚Äôt be a fixed value\n    - `//` is the floor division operator: `x // y` is ‚Äúhow many times does `y` go into `x`?\n- assignments compute an expression and put the result in a variable ‚Äî assignment operator is `=`\n    - ex: `total = x+y` where `total` is the resultant variable; `x` and `y` are operands (and also variables); `x+y` is the expression\n- types of errors\n    - syntax error: the written code is wrong, Python won‚Äôt run, ex: `5 = x`, we can‚Äôt assign `x` to the number `5`\n    - runtime errors: something that crashes when we run the code, ex: `x = 5 / 0`, can‚Äôt divide by zero and will result in a `ZeroDivisionError`\n    - semantic (logic) error: the code runs but you don‚Äôt get the result you want\n- python variable naming conventions\n    - don‚Äôt use keywords\n        |     |     |     |     |     |     |     | \n        | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\n        | False | assert | del | for | in | or | while |\n        | None | break | elif | from | is | pass | with |\n        | True | class | else | global | lambda | raise | yield |\n        | and | continue | except | if | nonlocal | return |  |\n        | as | def | finally | import | not | try |  |\n    - don‚Äôt name your variable after a type, like `int` or `str`\n    - only use letters (upper + lower), numbers, underscores\n        - don‚Äôt start the variable name with a number\n    \n    | examples | nonexamples |\n    | --- | --- |\n    | CS220 | 220class |\n    | cs_220 | x! |\n    | _cs220 | pi3.14 |\n\n### ch2: variables, expressions and statements\n\n- python conventionally uses lowercase and underscores for variable names\n    - illegal names will cause syntax errors\n- python code can be saved into files called *scripts* which end with `.py`\n- `print()` needs to be used in script mode if you want to display outputs\n- PEMDAS is helpful for remembering the order of operation for expressions\n    - **P**arentheses, **E**xponents, **M**ultiplication and **D**ivision, **A**ddition and **S**ubtraction\n- can‚Äôt perform mathematical operations on strings but we *can* add strings together (called string concatenation)\n    ```python\n    first = 'throat'\n    second = 'warbler'\n    print(first + second)\n    \u003e throatwarbler\n    ```\n- strings can also be multiplied, ex: `'Spam'*3` is `'SpamSpamSpam'`\n- comments are lines that the computer will ignore ‚Äî used to make notes between lines of code for humans to read\n    ```python\n    # compute percentage of an hour\n    percentage = (minute * 100) / 60\n    ```\n    - everything on the line with the `#` symbol is ignored\n    - usually used to denote things that aren‚Äôt obvious to the reader ‚Äî meanings of variables, functions\n- syntax errors appear *before* the program is run; runtime errors appear *after* the program has run; semantic errors don‚Äôt appear at all\n\n---\n\n## using functions\n\n- functions are ‚Äúmini-programs‚Äù or small steps that can build a big program\n- refactoring is when the code is reorganized\n- **parameters** are variables that receive a function‚Äôs input\n- **arguments** are values that are sent to a function\n    - default arguments are values that are sent to the function *if* no custom value is provided\n- **return values** are outputs from the function\n\n![Untitled](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/secure.notion-static.com/67c58043-cd64-44c3-8674-953c2dd46f0b/Untitled.png)\n\n- calling a function in python: `[fnc name]([arguments])` ex: `print(\"hello\")` where `print` is the function name, followed by parentheses, and `\"hello\"` is the argument\n\n### ch3: functions\n\n- **function** - a named sequence that performs a computation\n- python has *modules* which are prewritten code that you can use in your program by importing\n    - ex: functions from the math module can be used after importing it with `import math`, including `math.sin()`, `math.log10(), etc`\n- functions can be called using *dot notation* which is the format `[module name].[function name]`\n- variables are always on the left side of an assignment operator\n\n---\n\n## creating functions\n\n- math to python example\n    $f(x)=x^2$\n    `def f(x):\n        return x ** 2`\n    - both functions are called `f` and take a parameter, `x`, and return the value of `x` squared\n- indentation is important in python!\n    - following the colon after the first line of a function, all following lines are indented 4 spaces\n- filling parameters\n    - positional arguments ‚Äî arguments assigned by position\n        ```python\n        def foo(x, y = -1):\n            x = [] # this would be 99, because 99 is the first arg\n    \t    y = [] # this would be 100\n\n        foo(99, 100)\n        ```\n    - keyword arguments ‚Äî arguments assigned to variable names\n        ```python\n        def foo(x, y = -1):\n            x = [] # this would be 100 because we said x=100 below\n            y = [] # this would be 99\n        \n        foo(y=99, x=100)\n        ```\n    - default arguments ‚Äî inserted arguments if nothing is provided\n        ```python\n        def foo(x, y = -1):\n            x = [] # this would be 99 \n            y = [] # this would be -1 because we specified it above\n        \n        foo(99)\n        ```\n- `return` will provide code to the program that can be used later, while `print()` will output the code to a terminal\n\n### ch3 (cont.): functions\n\n- custom functions can be added by using the keyword `def`\n    - the **header** of the function is the first line, while the **body** **(indented 4 spaces) is the rest of the function\n- if the parentheses after the function name are empty, that means the function doesn‚Äôt take any arguments\n    ```python\n    def foo():\n        print(36)\n    \n    foo()\n    \u003e 36\n    ```\n- functions have to be created before they can be called ‚Üí function definitions are always at the top of a program\n    - execution begins at the top of the program and moves down\n- *fruitful functions* return values; *void functions* don‚Äôt return anything\n    - usually want to perform an action with the output of a fruitful function\n\n### reading: creating fruitful functions\n\n- to send a value to a variable instead of printing it to a screen, we can use the `return` keyword ‚Üí is called a fruitful function\n    - result is stored in a variable and can be used again\n    ```python\n    # using print\n    def get_name(first, last):\n        print(first + \" \" + last)\n    \n    name = get_name(\"Jane\", \"Doe\")\n    \u003e \"Jane Doe\"\n    \n    print(name)\n    \u003e None # nothing is assigned to 'name' so it has the None type\n    ```  \n    $\\phantom{-}$\n    ```python\n    # using return\n    def get_name(first, last):\n        return(first + \" \" + last)\n    \n    name = get_name(\"Jane\", \"Doe\") # nothing prints because there is no print statement\n    \n    print(name)\n    \u003e \"Jane Doe\" # the name is returned through the function\n    ```\n- once a `return` statement is reached, the function ends\n    ```python\n    # using print()\n    def countdown_print():\n        print(3)\n        print(2)\n        print(1)\n    \n    countdown_print()\n    \u003e 3\n    \u003e 2\n    \u003e 1\n    ```\n    $\\phantom{-}$\n    ```python\n    # using return\n    def countdown_return():\n        return 3\n        return 2\n        return 1\n    \n    countdown_return()\n    \u003e 3\n    ```\n- `__builtins__` is a special module that is already imported\n- `dir()` lists all functions that are part of a module\n- `.__doc__` returns the documentation of a function\n    ```python\n    import math\n\n    print(math.log.__doc__) # [module name].[function name].__doc__\n    \u003e log(x, [base=math.e])\n    \u003e Return the logarithm of x to the given value\n    ```","lastmodified":"2022-06-24T03:23:56.138987046Z","tags":null},"/stream":{"title":"Stream","content":"This serves as a hub for all of my recent edits on my website.
